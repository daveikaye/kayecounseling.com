  				My name is Ellen Kaye, and I am a Clinical Independent Social Worker in the Fort Myers, Florida area working with adults and elders. As a cognitive behavioral therapist I respect and honor my clients who have chosen the path of self-improvement. Together with my clients we will examine their core believes that lead to depression, anxiety, and difficulties within relationships. In our sessions we will develop and implement specific, realistic, action-oriented short and long-term treatment goals to facilitate positive life long changes in thought, behavior, and interpersonal relationships.
